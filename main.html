<h2>Golden retriever</h2>
	<p>The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. 
		It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. 
		It is a working dog, and registration is subject to successful completion of a working trial.
		It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries; 
		some may compete in dog shows or obedience trials, or work as a guide dog.
        The Golden Retriever was bred by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century.
		He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, 
		Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. It was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913,
		and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.</p>
